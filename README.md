In an era characterized by the overwhelming prevalence of digital media, privacy has emerged as a pivotal concern. Images and videos, which constitute a significant portion of this digital landscape, frequently contain sensitive information that individuals or organizations desire to safeguard. This information can take various forms, such as human faces, textual data, or recognizable brand logos. Automated tools capable of detecting and anonymizing these elements can play a crucial role in maintaining privacy and preventing unauthorized use of such information.

This report introduces a comprehensive computer vision project designed to address three distinct privacy concerns. The first use case focuses on the blurring of specific faces in video content, an application with extensive utility in preserving personal privacy and ensuring compliance with regulations for publicly shared videos. By harnessing the capabilities of a deep learning model, specifically the "res10_300x300_ssd_iter_140000.caffemodel," the project successfully identifies and blurs targeted faces in videos.

The second use case deals with the detection and blurring of sensitive textual information in documents, a requirement often encountered in legal, healthcare, and financial industries, among others. This aspect of the project utilizes pytesseract OCR, a potent optical character recognition (OCR) tool, to identify text and subsequently blur sensitive sections.

Lastly, the third use case involves the detection and blurring of brand logos in videos. This application is particularly valuable in scenarios where brand identity must be protected, or unauthorized brand promotion needs to be mitigated. For this use case, the project employs OpenCV's template matching, an efficient method for logo detection.

With its three-pronged approach, the FCV Project addresses critical privacy considerations in digital content. The subsequent sections will delve into the methodologies employed, discuss the results, and explore potential future enhancements to the system.
